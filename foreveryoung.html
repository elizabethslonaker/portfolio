          <h2><span class="num">02</span> Understanding the Challenge</h2>
          <p>Forever Young Records is in a transition phase. </p>
          <p>The demand for an online presence continues to increase as their clientele base spreads past the local community. To support this growth in online customers, I identified some usability issues with their current site and shopping experience. I sought to solve these issues with my redesign.</p>

          <h3>The Homepage</h3>
              <p>Products aren’t listed. Difficult for customers to quickly browse, especially when they don’t know what they’re looking for. Increases bounce rate (poor SEO).</p>

            <h3>The Search Bar</h3>
              <p>Imagine this - You recently purchased a record player and you need to buy some vinyl. You want to see all available vinyl, regardless of artist. However, the current site requires that you type in an artist or title first - the opposite of your goal. You leave the site. </p>
              <p>The scenario above highlights a key issue with the site's current searchability. A user must first search for a artist or title, <i>before</i> filtering the results by genre or format. <span class="highlight">The problem is that the user must know what they want to buy, before coming to the site.</span></p>

            <h3>The Product Page</h3>
              <p>Missing product image, an important factor in a customer’s decision to purchase. Customers want to see what they’re buying.</p>
              <p>Too much information for the viewer to digest, makes the objective hierarchy unclear.</p>
              <p>“Add to Cart” button is difficult to locate.</p>

Instead, I selected a bright dual color palette inspired by their current blue and yellow logo. A “handwritten” font for the headings gives the design a personal and nostalgic feeling, which reflects the customer’s attitude towards the brand.</p>

              <h4>Objective #1: Improve the online shopping experience</h4>
                <p>This redesigned search bar improves the shopping experience by allowing the user to independently search for items, without having to select a specific category first. In the visual hierarchy, the search bar is positioned at the top. The home page displays products upon page load, making quick browsing much easier than before. </p>

            <h2><span class="num">11</span> Usability Assessment</h2>
            <p>Two weeks before the completion of the final site, I conducted an assessment to test the usability of the search bar and product CMS.</p>
            <h3>Questions Addressed by Assessment </h3>
              <p>1. Will the users easily find the search bar in its present location?</p>
              <p>2. Can users easily navigate to the login admin page?</p>
              <p>3. Will the users easily find the button to upload an image, and know how to navigate back to the product catalog?</p>
            <br><p>I gave the following scenarios and tasks for the user to perform. The hesitation time for each task, incorrect searches, incorrect clicks, and approximate time it took to complete each task was recorded.</p>
            <h3>Scenario 1</h3>
              <p>1. Type “The Beatles” into the search bar.</p>
              <p>2. Go to the admin login page and enter the following credentials into the form. </p>
              <p>3. Locate the Beatles item from the list and navigate to the edit page. Change the price of the item to .99 cents and submit the new product details. </p>
              <p>4. Do not log out! Please proceed to scenario 2.</p>
            <h3>Scenario 2</h3>
              <p>1. Choose any product and proceed to the edit form.</p>
              <p>2. Upload a new image of your choice to be the product image.  </p>
              <p>3. Return to the complete list of products. </p>
            <h3>Issues Observed</h3>
              <p>1. Search for “beatles” did not come up</p>
              <p>2. Delayed response when trying to locate the admin login</p>
              <p>3. Confused on how to return to product listing page after editing a product</p>
              <p>4. Confused on how to return to product listing page after uploading an image </p>
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>The admin link is too small. Users found after moments of hesitation. Move this link from the top right corner to the primary navigation. Add a lock icon to differentiate this link from the rest of the main links. </p>
            <p>Change search bar parameters to accept searches with keywords <l>like</l> a product’s title, artist, or barcode. Searching for “Beatles” and “The Beatles” should yield the same results.</p>
            <p>Once the client successfully adds or edits a product, display a link to the product listing page in the success message. Client needs to know how to get back to the main admin page.</p>

              <p>This is my first time using SQL to build a back-end database. I experimented, debugged, and generated many failed queries. <span class="highlight">I had to overcome the fear of breaking the code, which improved my coding skills exponentially.</span> I'm proud of the final product, and I'm excited to use these new skils to breathe life into my future designs.</p>
