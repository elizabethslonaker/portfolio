          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Texas Republic Bar & Kitchen is a local bar native to Texas, located in the heart of Fort Worth's West 7th. This modern, Texas inspired bar is a key destination for food, drinks, and a vibrant nightlife. They host weekly events, private gatherings, catering, and bottle services. The focus of this redesign concept is to increase online reservations and purchases and to grow the client's presence and brand across all online platforms.</p>

          <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>Market Research, Segmentation, SWOT Analysis, Value Proposition, Wireframes, Email Marketing, Website Development, Responsive Mobile & Tablet</p>

          <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>The goal is to drive online sale conversions and spread brand awareness across all online platforms.</p>

          <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
            <h3>What e-commerce value does Texas Republic offer the target market?</h3>
              <p>For young adults ages 21-34 who reside in the DFW Metroplex, Texas Republic provides an energizing atmosphere that embodies the mantra of “everything is bigger in Texas.” This philosophy is seen throughout the business. For example, the space offers a 8,300sf main floor and an ultra-large 168sf Megatron LED TV. These dimensions are large in comparison to competitors. The space creates unique experiences - watching sports on such a large sized TV is a strong attractor for this audience. The e-commerce value that this brings is the ability to book an "experience" completely online including a private table and bottle service.</p>
            <h3>What e-commerce value do we offer the client?</h3>
              <p>We can relieve the client from an inconsistent and frustrating website experience, and offer an intuitive user flow with a modern design and layout. A better user flow will help the customer to find information about the different products and services. For example, a current problem with the site is the amount of inactive links. We will implement functional features to facilitate online purchases and drive traffic to the site.</p>
	          <h3>Online Revenue Model</h3>
						  <ul>
							  <li>Tickets</li>
						  	<li>VIP table packages</li>
							  <li>Catering</li>
						  	<li>Private events: Events range from birthday parties and wedding rehearsals to large corporate events. These packages include the standard room rental, food, and drink fees, but they also offer unique services such as custom invitation design, personalized snapchat filters, and specialty crafted cocktails.</li>
					  	</ul>
					  <h2>My plan to increase online revenue</h2>
					  <ul>
						  <li>Sell merchandise online</li>
						  <li>Add more reservation packages</li>
						  <li>Find sponsorships with influencers</li>
						  <li>Increase paid advertisements</li>
					  </ul>

          <h2>Target Audience Segmentation</h2>
            <p>There are 4 different types of segmentations (ways of identifying the target audience)- geographics, demographics, psychographics, and behavior. We propose focusing on geographics and demographics.
            <h3>Geographics</h3>
              <p>This is based on physical location. Texas Republic's location on West 7th Street means that they are going to automatically attract a particular clientele that is interested in Fort Worth's culture and vibe. These customers already have a preconceived idea of what a business on West 7th will be like, therefore Texas Republic can tap into this preconceived notion by fulfilling all of the client's wildest western fantasies. </p>
            <h3>Demographics</h3>
              <p>This is based on age, gender, education, and income. These groups are similar in their technology usage, communication patterns, and psychological profiles. Texas Republic's demographic is millennials or young adults, therefore the client can differentiate itself among this group by taking advantage of social trends and pop culture. Unlike baby boomers, millennials are motivated to click on content that they find entertaining and funny. Ensure that social media is current, relevant, and engaging, and also use many different forms of posting (photos, video, gifs, boomerangs, etc). Additionally, it is important to understand the psychological profiles of young adults. They tend to put priority on the experience, making and capturing memories, and their social identity. The client can appeal to this tendancy by emphasizing the "experience" of attending the bar, over the products. Obviously, the products are an important revenue stream, but the millennials's experience at the bar will keep them coming back. We can highlight this on the website by posting videos and photos of people socializing and creating memories, over shots of the food.</p>

          <h2>Marketing Strategy</h2>
            <p>According to the 4P’s of marketing, I identified the following online marketing strategies in order to accomplish the goal of sale conversions and brand awareness.</p>
            <h3>Product</h3>
              <p>The client offers the typical items a bar would sell (food and drink), but there is also space to expand their products into a merchandise line that promotes the Texas brand. The brand is centralized around the Western culture of Texas and the unique vibes of Fort Worth which mixes modern and rustic. This is the client’s unique niche that caters to a specific market. Network with other communities can help expand this market. For example, the client can collaborate with other local bars and co-host events, allowing the client to expand into other fan bases.</p>
            <h3>Price</h3>
              <p>Bars can be pricey, but they aren’t as pricey as clubs. The target audience wants affordable food, but is willing to pay more for the experience. Therefore, if Texas Republic can incorporate a “club vibe” to its atmosphere, they can take advantage of price skimming. According to Investopedia, price skimming is a marketing strategy in which the business initially charges the highest price the audience is willing to pay, then lowers the price over time. The way to price skim is to check out how much your competitors are charging for things like bottle service and and how much clubs charge averagely. If Texas Republic can emphasize on it, they can push how far they can charge for bottle service and advertise these services on their website.</p>
            <h3>Promotion</h3>
              <p>Promote the products and services online through the following marketing strategies.</p>
            <h4>Cross Channel Promotion</h4>
              <p>This is a form of marketing that targets the customers of one product or service by promoting a similar product. The client can advertise products from their website (merchandise and event tickets) on their social media and redirect traffic to their site.</p>
            <h4>Paid Media</h4>
              <p>Purchase Facebook and Instagram ads. Although the click through rate is less than %1, as long as these ads are placed in front of the right audience the ads will increase brand awareness.</p>
            <h4>Public Relations</h4>
              <p>Create a relationship with the audience and Texas Republic to show that they are a real business-real people you interact with on and off the site, like coming up with slogans, phrases staff can say online and off. Really trying to bridge that gap between customer and them.</p>
            <h4>Social Media</h4>
              <p>For the millennial demographic, the most engaging content is funny and entertaining. For example, using memes is an excellent way to connect to this audience. The client needs to utilise all (often underused) functions of each app such as snapchat filters, geofilters, Instagram stories, hashtags, unique Instagram grid layouts, boomerangs etc.</p>
            <h4>Video Marketing</h4>
              <p>Videos and boomerangs are a highly engaging and visually appealing form of media that isn’t being used by their current site, and is underused on their social media. Using videos will help the client’s content stand out from the competition.</p>
            <h4>Content Marketing</h4>
              <p>This form of marketing takes advantage of a current or relevant event that affects many people. For example, the client can host a Halloween costume event and offer a reward (Texas Republic merchandise, gotta spread that brand).</p>
            <h3>Place</h3>
              <p>Evaluating the correct location to convert potential visitors to paying customers is critical. With a target audience that is high in technology use, many of these conversions will occur online. Therefore, the relationship between Texas Republic’s social media and their website is pivotal to traffic conversions. Well placed ads, social posts, and sponsorships will direct visitors to the website. The bar can also promote hashtags and snapchat filters by displaying these photos on the screens inside the bar. This will encourage bar attendees to engage with the bar’s social media, increasing their online community and leading to possible website traffic.</p>
            <h3>Customer Relationship</h3>
              <p>Customer relationship is concerned with the long-term relationship between client and customer. The client needs to gain new customers and retain repeat customers.</p>
              <p>One way to do this is to use crowdsourcing. Create a form on the website and allow people to vote for their favorite food or beverage to add to the menu. This will strengthen customer relationship because it directly involves the audience in your business. It creates trust in the brand, because the customer can provide their feedback, then see the physical results of that feedback. Furthermore, this idea is highly marketable across social media, a platform which thrives off of user engagement. Therefore, current users of the business’ social media can easily be directed towards this new engagement occurring on the website.</p>


          <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>Based on our marketing strategies, we propose three website features to support the client's goals.</p>
            <h3>1. Private Events Inquiry</h3>
              <p>The current website details package information and price tiers, but it doesn’t provide a convenient way to contact the client with questions or immediate bookings. Adding this feature would make the booking experience easier and decrease client frustration. It is standard in the industry for restaurants and venues to contact and answer questions for potential clients via email. Therefore, this feature is key to implement.</p>
            <h3>2. Catering Orders</h3>
              <p>The current website has a page titled “Catering/Private Events” but this page makes no distinction between the two. It is unclear if the menu is for private events hosted at their facility, or if the menu is for catering, or both. Furthermore, no contact information is given. Taking online catering orders and inquiries would help the client to keep track of orders and decrease the amount of time that staff spends on the phone and away from their work.</p>
            <h3>3. Crowdsource new menu item</h3>
              <p>Create a form to allow customers to vote for their favorite drink or food item to add to the menu. This would increase customer engagement with the brand and is easily marketable on their website and social media.</p>
            <h3>4. Merchandise Store</h3>
              <p>An online merchandise store will grow Texas Republic’s brand, while also creating another stream of revenue online. This online store can easily be advertised on social media or the products can be worn by the employees. Products could include e-gift cards, hats and apparel, and drinkware and koozies. Furthermore, online shopping fits with the technology use of the young adult and millennial target audience.</p>
